<!-- # Existing work and new challenges -->

<!-- Spatio-temporal software should echo with the advance in spatial and temporal data analysis. This section will start with the \pkg{spacetime} paper [@spacetime] that sets the foundation for wrangling spatio-temporal data in \proglang{R}, and then describe some emerging concepts and software in data analysis since the paper publishes and what remains as challenges. -->


<!-- Also, array is not the best solution for a large subset of data, specifically, the vector spatio-temporal data. With vector data, spatial and temporal variables are commonly collected in separate 2D tables and there is usually a location ID to link the spatial and temporal information. Sometimes, the geometrical shape of the location may not present and an additional linking is needed to incorporate the map data. With the multiple pieces in 2D data frame format, there should be a solution to organise all these data from multiple sources in a 2D structure, without needing to convert it into higher dimensional representation. -->


# Conceptual framework: spatio-temporal cube {#cube}

Spatio-temporal data can be conceptualized using a cubical data model with three axes which typically are, time, latitude and longitude. This abstraction can be useful for generalizing operations and visualization purposes: @lu_multidimensional_2018 shows how array operations (select, scale, reduce, rearrange, and compute) can be mapped onto the cube; @bach_review_2014 reviews the temporal data visualization based on space-time cube operations. Notice that the term space-time cube in their article "does not need to involve spatial data", but refers to "an abstract 2D substrate that is used to visualize data at a specific time". Despite its main focus being on temporal data, the mindset of abstracting out data representation to construct visualizations, still applies to our spatio-temporal data manipulation and visualization approaches.

The most common space-time cube uses the three axes, time, latitude, longitude, and can be considered stacking space across time. Ours is a multivariate spatio-temporal cube with the three axes defined to be time, site and variables, as illustrated in the leftmost column of Figure \ref{fig:cube-def}. The time axis is the same in both versions, while the site axis now captures both latitude and longitude. Finally, variables are stacked on this space-time canvas, with one observation per site and time point. This notion is adopted to avoid using hyper-cubes when describing multivariate spatio-temporal data and is the conceptual framework behind the \code{cubble} objects. With this conceptual model, operations on spatio-temporal data can be mapped to operations on the cube and the rest of Figure \ref{fig:cube-def} show examples of slicing on site, time, and variable. 

While the data cube model is conceptually convenient for spatio-temporal data, a 3D data array is not sufficiently rich for data wrangling, for several reasons. Although arrays can be efficient for the computation on numerical values, spatio-temporal data typically includes various types of variables. For example, character strings and specific datetime classes are common. In addition, it will be generally useful to be able to create new variables which is trickier to manage in an array. Thus for convenient wrangling, we have opted to create a special \code{cubble} class.
