# The cubble package {#cubble}

The \code{cubble} class is an S3 class [@advr] built on the \code{tibble} class, specifically to organize spatio-temporal data. The \code{cubble} class uses an attribute "form",  to arrange the spatial or temporal data components tidily. The form attribute can take a value of either "nested" or "long". The nested \code{cubble} is a subclass of rowwise \code{tibble} (\code{rowwise_df}). It arranges each spatial site in a row, and uses list columns to store the feature geometry and the temporal information. The long \code{cubble} is a subclass of grouped \code{tibble} (\code{grouped_df}), which expands the temporal information into the long form and stores the spatial information in a "spatial" attribute. The main functions in the package are \code{as_cubble()}, \code{face_spatial()}, \code{face_temporal()}, and \code{unfold()}.

<!-- A cubble is a data object that arranges spatio-temporal information in a spatial and temporal tidy way. It uses two forms to achieve this: the nested form presents the spatial variables, including the feature geometry, and nests the temporal information for spatial wrangling. The long form expands the temporal information and stashes the spatial variables for temporal wrangling. A benefit of cubble is that it interfaces directly with existing spatial and temporal data wrangling packages. For example, operations on feature geometry from the \code{sf} package and temporal operations, i.e., temporal ordering, duplication check. and gap filling, from the \code{tsibble} package.  -->

The data \code{climate_flat} is used to illustrate functionality in the \pkg{cubble} package. This is a subset from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [@noaa] Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) Daily data. It contains spatial variables, station id, latitude, longitude, elevation, station name, world meteorology organisation id, in additional to daily temporal information,  maximum and minimum temperature values and precipitation records for year 2020. The first five rows of the data are shown below:

```{r}
cubble::climate_flat
```

## Create a cubble {#create}

The function \code{as_cubble()} is used to create a \code{cubble} object with three arguments: \code{key} as the spatial identifier; \code{index} as the temporal identifier; and a vector of \code{coords} in the order (longitude, latitude). The arguments \code{key} and \code{index} follow the conventions in the \pkg{tsibble} package to describe the temporal order and multiple series while \code{coords} specifies the spatial location of each site. The code below creates a \code{cubble} object out of \code{climate_flat} (a single \code{tibble}) with \code{id} as the key, \code{date} as the index, and \code{c(long, lat)} as the coordinates:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_nested <- climate_flat |>
  as_cubble(key = id, index = date, coords = c(long, lat))
cubble_nested
```

Printing a \code{cubble} object provides some information about the data. Here \code{id} is the variable name to identify each location and there are five unique locations. The bounding box is \code{[115.97, -32.94, 133.55, -12.42]} and provides information about the coordinates in the data. The third row shows the name and type of all variables nested in the \code{ts} column. In this example, it includes \code{date [date], prcp [dbl], tmax [dbl], tmin [dbl]}.

The created \code{cubble} is a subclass of the \code{rowwise_df} class where each row forms a group. All the temporal variables are nested in a list column, hence it is also called the nested \code{cubble}. The rowwise structure makes it simpler to operate on the list using the \code{mutate()} syntax, which is simpler than the \code{purr::map()} when working with a list column. For example, calculating the number of rainy days can be done by:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_nested |>
  mutate(rain_day = sum(ts$prcp != 0))
```

A \code{cubble} class can be created from various common spatio-temporal data formats, including \code{tibble}, \code{tsibble}, and \code{sf} when both spatial and temporal information are available. Section \@ref(covid) describes converting multiple tables into a \code{cubble} object and Section \@ref(netcdf) illustrates how to convert a NetCDF object.



## Change focus by facing the time-variables

The nested form can be used for those operations where the output is only indexed by the spatial identifier (\code{key}), but becomes inadequate when outputs need both a spatial and a temporal identifier (\code{key} and \code{index}). The \code{cubble} class also provides a long form, which expands the \code{ts} column and temporarily "hides" the spatial variables. The function \code{face_temporal()} is used to switch from the nested \code{cubble} into the long one. The first row in Figure \ref{fig:face} illustrates this operation where the focus of the cube now changes from the site-variable face to the time-variable face. This code switches the \code{cubble} object just created into its long form:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_long <- cubble_nested |> face_temporal()
cubble_long
```

The first line in the header now shows it in the long form and the third line has been changed to display the name and type of spatial variables: \code{lat [dbl], long [dbl], elev [dbl], name [chr], wmo_id [dbl]}. Unlike the nested form, the long \code{cubble} is built from a \code{grouped_df} class where all the observations from the same site form a group.

```{r face, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "An illustration of function \\code{face\\_temporal} and \\code{face\\_spatial}. In the first row, \\code{face\\_temporal} switches a \\code{cubble} object from the nested form into the long form and the focus has switched from the spatial aspect (the side face) to the temporal aspect (the front face). In the second row, \\code{face\\_spatial} switches a \\code{cubble} object back to the nested form from the long form and shifts focus back to the spatial aspect."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/diagram-keynotes/diagram-keynotes.002.png"))
```

## Change focus back to the site-variable face

Wrangling spatio-temporal data can be seen as an iterative process in the spatial and temporal dimensions. Switching the focus back to the site-variable face can be accomplished by the function \code{face_spatial()}, which is the inverse of \code{face_temporal()}. The second row of Figure \ref{fig:face} illustrates the function, which is used as follows:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_back <- cubble_long |> face_spatial()
cubble_back
identical(cubble_nested, cubble_back)
```

## Unfold spatial variables into the long form {#unfold}

Sometimes, analysts may need to apply some variable transformation that involves both the spatial and temporal variables. An example of this is the transformation of temporal variables into the spatial dimension in glyph maps [@Wickham2012-yr]. (How to make glyph maps will be explained in Section \ref{st_transformation}, and are illustrated in the second example.) This type of operation can be seen as flattening, or *unfolding*, the cube into a 2D data frame. Here the function \code{unfold()} moves the spatial variables \code{long} and \code{lat} into the long \code{cubble}:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_unfold <- cubble_long |> unfold(long, lat)
cubble_unfold
```

## Why not just use the existing tidyverse functions {#tidyverse}

<!-- \subsection[Why not just use]{Why not just use \code{dplyr::nest\_by()}?} -->

Some readers may question why a new data structure is needed rather than directly creating a list-column  on the combined data using \code{dplyr::nest_by()}. The reason is that the \code{cubble} object is specifically designed to utilize the spatio-temporal structure when arranging observations in a single object. Moreover, it enables easy pivoting between purely spatial, purely temporal, or unfolded into a combined form.

<!-- Some readers may raise the question why a new data structure rather than using \code{dplyr::nest_by()} on the combined data to directly create a list-column. While \code{nest_by()} and its inverse \code{unnest()} can mimic the nested form in cubble, cubble can be seen as an attempt to arrange variables from different observational units into a single object, specifically for spatio-temporal data. The benefit of arranging everything in a single object is that there is no need to manually split and join variables in the data. For various spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal tasks, the data format required can alternate among a pure spatial, pure temporal, or a combined format. Analysts will need to manually split the combined data into a spatial or temporal one, or join them into a combined one. \pkg{Cubble} simplifies this switch of format with a nested and long form and allowing spatial variables to be unfolded into the long form for a combined data all in a single data object. -->

## Compatibility with existing packages {#compact}

The \pkg{cubble} package leverages tools available in existing packages used for spatial and temporal analysis, specifically, \pkg{dplyr}, \pkg{tsibble}, \pkg{sf} (\pkg{s2}), and \pkg{ncdf4}, as explained here.

\subsubsection[]{\code{dplyr}}

The \pkg{dplyr} package has many tools for wrangling tidy data,  many of which are useful in the spatio-temporal analysis. The \pkg{cubble} package provides methods that support the use of the following operations in the \pkg{dplyr} package on both the nested and long forms: `mutate`, `filter`, `summarise`, `select`, `arrange`, `rename`, `left_join`, and the slice family (`slice_*`).

\subsubsection[]{\code{tsibble}}

The \code{tsibble} class is a subclass of \code{tibble} where the \code{index} and \code{key} components are used to store temporal and strata information, that makes working with temporal data cognitively efficient. A \code{cubble} object can use the \code{tsibble} class to store the temporal information, and effectively utilize the specialist time series operations in the \pkg{tsibble} package. A \code{tsibble} object can also be casted into a \code{cubble} object through supplying the coordinate information in the argument `coords`:

```{r echo = TRUE}
climate_flat_ts <- climate_flat |> 
  tsibble::as_tsibble(key = id, index = date)
climate_flat_cb <-  climate_flat_ts |> 
  cubble::as_cubble(coords = c(long, lat))
climate_flat_cb
```

When a nested \code{cubble} is created, each element in the list-column \code{ts} is in the \code{tsibble} class (labelled \code{tbl_ts})  and operations available to the \code{tsibble} class are still valid on these elements. For example, the code below calculates two time series features (mean and variance) of maximum temperature, utilizing the \code{tsibble} syntax in the \code{cubble} object:

```{r echo = TRUE}
climate_flat_cb |> 
  mutate(fabletools::features(
    ts, tmax, list(tmax_mean = mean, tmax_var = var)
    ))
```


\subsubsection[]{\code{sf} (\code{s2})} 

The \code{sf} class is also a subclass of \code{tibble} with a specialized feature geometry list-column (\code{sfc}) to store different geometry types (\code{POINT}, \code{LINESTRING}, \code{POLYGON}, \code{MULTIPOLYGON}, etc). The package \pkg{sf} provides functions that operate efficiently on this spatial information. A \code{cubble} object can store spatial information in  the \code{sf} class. Methods for the \code{sfc} class can be applied in the nested form of the cubble object.  An illustration is in Section \@ref(covid). The spatial information can also be stored as an \code{s2} vector in a \code{cubble} object.


<!-- These spatial operations are also valuable for spatio-temporal data analysis, but an \code{sf} object *usually* does not contain temporal variables. This means \code{sf} cannot be directly cast into a \code{cubble}, however, \code{cubble} does support \code{sfc} columns in the nested form and spatial operations applied to the \code{sfc} column in \code{sf} can still be applied to the \code{sfc} column in a cubble. The following example shows how to create an \code{sfc} column of \code{POINT} type from latitude and longitude in cubble. Then \code{sf::st_within} is used to add the state \code{MULTIPOLYGON} of each weather station before a coordinate transformation is made. -->

<!-- ```{r echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- library(sf) -->
<!-- # create a cubble -->
<!-- cb <- climate_flat |> -->
<!--   cubble::as_cubble(key = id, index = date, coords = c(long, lat)) -->

<!-- aus <- ozmaps::abs_ste -->

<!-- dt <- cb |> -->
<!--   mutate( -->
<!--     # create `sfc` column based on long and lat -->
<!--     ll = st_sfc( -->
<!--       purrr::map2(long, lat, ~st_point(c(.x, .y))), -->
<!--       crs = st_crs(aus)), -->

<!--     # append state multi-polygon based on the `sfc` created -->
<!--     state = aus$geometry[st_within(ll, aus, sparse = FALSE)], -->

<!--     # adopt a different projection: lambert conformal conic (EPSG:3112) -->
<!--     state = st_transform(state, crs = "EPSG:3112") -->
<!--     ) -->

<!-- dt -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- An \pkg{s2} \code{lnglat} vector can similarly be created as an \code{sfc} in cubble before using any \code{s2}-prefixed function: -->

<!-- ```{r echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- library(s2) -->
<!-- # Western Australia map -->
<!-- wa <- ozmaps::abs_ste |> filter(NAME == "Western Australia") -->

<!-- # mutate a `s2_lnglat` vector on `cb` created in the last chunk -->
<!-- cb |> -->
<!--   mutate(ll = s2_lnglat(long, lat)) |> -->
<!--   filter(s2_within(ll, wa)) -->
<!-- ``` -->


\subsubsection[]{\code{ncdf4}}\label{netcdf}

The NetCDF data is another format commonly used for storing spatio-temporal data. It has two main components: *dimension* for defining the spatio-temporal grid (longitude, latitude, and time) and *variable* that populates the defined grid. Attributes  can be associated with dimensions or variables. Because there can be many different styles of representing this information there is a metadata convention [@hassell_data_2017] to standardize the format of the attributes. A few packages in \proglang{R} exist for manipulating NetCDF data and these include a high-level R interface: \pkg{ncdf4} [@ncdf4], a low-level interface that calls a C-interface: \pkg{RNetCDF} [@rnetcdf], and a tidyverse implementation: \pkg{tidync} [@tidync].

The \pkg{cubble} package provides an \code{as_cubble()} method to coerce the \code{ncdf4} class from the \pkg{ncdf4} package into a \code{cubble} object. It maps each combination of longitude and latitude into an \code{id} as the \code{key}:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
dt <- as_cubble(my_ncdf, vars = c("q", "z"))
```

Sometimes NetCDF data can be quite large, and it is best to subset the data when converting to a \code{cubble} object. We would recommend reducing to about 300 $\times$ 300 grid points for three daily variables in one year. A 300 by 300 spatial grid can be a bounding box of [100, -80, 180, 0] at 0.25 degree resolution or a global bounding box [-180, -90, 180, -90] at 1 degree resolution.
The size of spatial grid can be reduced if longer time periods or more variables are needed, through the arguments \code{long_range} and \code{lat_range}:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dt <- as_cubble(
  my_ncdf, vars = c("q", "z"),
  long_range = seq(-180, 180, 1), lat_range = seq(-90, 90, 1)
  )
```
