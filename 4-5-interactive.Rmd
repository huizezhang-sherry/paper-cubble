## Interative graphic with cubble

With spatio-temporal data, users may wish to make plots to learn the spatial distribution of a variable or to find patterns such as trend or seasonality in the time series. Combining this two types of plot with interactivity let users to link between points on the map and their corresponding time series and explore the spatial and temporal dimension of the data simultaneously. Below is an example that describes the process of building an interactive graphic with \pkg{cubble} and \pkg{crosstalk}. 

Starting with the original data, some pre-processing may be required to summarise the data before the visualisation. This example explores the variation of monthly temperature range across `r nrow(weatherdata::climate_full)` weather stations in Australia and with `weatherdata::climate_full`, daily temperature range is first calculated as the difference between \code{tmax} and \code{tmin}. The three daily variables are then averaged into month over 2016 - 2020 in the long form. Variance of the temperature difference is then calculated for each station in the nested form. Then, a \code{SharedData} object is constructed for each form of the cubble and the same \code{group} argument ensures the cross-linking of the two forms via the common \code{id} column. The spatial map and time series plot are then made with each \code{SharedData} objects separately. In this example, stations on the Australia map, made from the nested form, are coloured by the calculated variance and a ribbon band is constructed using the long form cubble to show the maximum and minimum temperature of each station across month. With a different dataset, users are free to calculate any per station measure in the nested form or to make any time-wise summary of the data in the long form to customise the spatial or temporal view. And the cross-linking is always safeguarded by the shared \code{id} column embedded in the cubble structure. Below is the pseudo code that outlines the process to construct an interactive graphic described above:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# data pre-processing
clean <- weatherdata::climate_full %>% ...

# created SharedData instance for crosstalk
nested <- clean %>% SharedData$new(~id, group = "cubble")
long <- stretch(clean) %>% SharedData$new(~id, group = "cubble")

# create the spatial and temporal view each with a ShareData instance
p1 <- nested %>% ...
p2 <- long %>% ...

# Combine p1 and p2
crosstalk::bscols(plotly::ggplotly(p1), plotly::ggplotly(p2), ...)

```

In Figure \ref{fig:interactive-linking}, the first row shows the initial view of the interactive graphic. Overall, most regions in Australia have low variance of temperature range across different months while the north-west coastline, bottom of South Australia, and Victoria stands out with larger monthly changes. In the second row, Mount Elizabeth is selected on the map given its dark colour and this links to the ribbon on the right where there is a larger temperature range is presented in Australian winter (June to August). The third row selects the Grampian station in Victoria and the linked ribbon shows an opposite wider range in Australian summer period (December to February). The last row selects point with the lowest minimum temperature in August in the ribbon plot and surprisingly, this links to the Thredbo Airport in the Victoria and New South Wales border, rather than somewhere in the Tasmania island! 

```{r interactive-linking, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="23%", fig.retina = 2, dpi = 300, fig.cap = "Exploring temperature variation using linking of a map and seasonal display. Each row is a screen dump of the process. The top row shows all locations and all temperature profiles. Selecting a location with high variance on the map produces the plot in the second row. The maximum nad minimum temperature is shown using a ribbon. The bottom row first selects the lowest temperature in Auguest in the seasonal display. A location in the Tasmania Island is then selected to compare the temperature variation with Thredbo AWS.", fig.show='hold'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/linking-south.png"))
```

With leaflet popup, the temperature range can be displayed as a small subplot upon clicking on the map. This would require first creating the popup plots from the long form cubble as a vector and then add these plots to a leaflet map, created from the nested cubble, with \code{leafpop::addPopupGraphs()}:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# data pre-processing
clean <- weatherdata::climate_full %>% ...

# use the long form to create subplots for each station
df_id <- unique(clean$id)
p <- map(1:length(df_id), function(i){
  dt <- clean %>% filter(id == df_id[i])
  ggplot(dt) %>% ...
})

# create nested form leaflet map with temperature band as subplots 
nested <- tamp(clean)
leaflet(nested) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(group = "a", ...) %>% 
  leafpop::addPopupGraphs(graph = p, ...)

```

Figure \ref{fig:interactive-popup} shows the same content as Figure \ref{fig:interactive-linking} but made with leaflet and popups. 

```{r interactive-popup, echo = FALSE, out.width="45%", out.height="25%", fig.retina = 2, dpi = 300, fig.cap = "Same as FIgure 11 with thetemperature variation shown as a popup in the leaflet map.", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/popup-mid.png")) 
```
