# Introduction

Spatio-temporal data involves variables observed in the space across time and this paper focuses on spatio-temporal vector data with fixed locations and regular time intervals. This type of data can naturally be considered as a data cube with three axes: spatial identifier, temporal identifier, and variable. In this cubic formation, space only occupies one axis, rather than two, to avoid hypercubes for multivariate spatio-temporal data. While conceptually the data format is relatively simple, the data objects coming to the analysts can vary in forms in the analysis. Figure \ref{fig:illu-input} shows three examples of wild spatio-temporal data: 1) a single table that includes both the spatial and temporal variables; 2) separate tables for spatial and temporal variables; 3) array-based data, i.e. NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) data, which is commonly used in earth science, e.g. climatology, meteorology, and oceanography, among others, to organise multivariate data in a spatio-temporal grid.

<!-- Manipulating data in these two levels is usually done separately and the third tidy data principal [@tidydata] recommends each type of observational unit to form a table. Another feature for a spatio-temporal data structure to have is that variables created from subsequent operations can be automatically added to the existing table with the same level. This is better than an output that index the variables with the identifiers since otherwise analysts will need to manually join this output with existing variables in the same level. -->

<!-- Many data structures have been proposed for spatial (\pkg{sf} by @sf) and temporal (\pkg{tsibble} by @tsibble) data in the R community, while less has been done for spatio-temporal data. The lack of such tools could potentially because analysts usually treat the spatial and temporal dimension of the data separately, without realising the need to create a new data structure. While this approach follows the third tidy data principal [@tidydata] (*Each type of observational unit forms a table*), analysts always need to manually join results from different observational units or combining multiple tables into one for downstream analysis. This additional step doesn't add new operations into the data but can be error prone. \newline -->

While incorporating both spatial and temporal information enriches the data in the analysis, spatio-temporal data can sometimes be hard to work with given its two observational units in the variables. The single table format in Figure \ref{fig:illu-input} is convenient for spatio-temporal operations that involve both types of variables, however, it makes duplicates of spatial variables and is not ideal when only looking at the spatial aspect of the data. The two tables format allows separate operations on spatial and temporal variables while analysts need to work with two data objects simultaneously and join them together into the single table format for spatio-temporal operations. Neither of the two formats is desirable at the same time for spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal operations. This issue implies analysts need to constantly think about the data format and arrange variables into the proper shape before the actual operations, which can be a laborious step when switching between the two formats back and forth several times during the analysis. 

<!-- This would require analysts to constantly switch among different format at each step. All these difficulties are rooted in the two different observational units of spatial and temporal variables and this poses difficulties to organise spatio-temporal data in a way that operates both on a single spatial or temporal dimension and the combined spatio-temporal dimension. -->

<!-- None of these three formats in Figure \ref{fig:illu-input} is not particularly convenient to work with. In the single table format, to avoid plotting duplicated points of the same sites on the map, analysts always need to create a spatial variables table from the original single table. This can be a tedious step if needs to performed many times during the analysis. In another type of operation that filter the sites based on certain statistics, intermediate objects, like the per-station summary of the statistic and the filtered station ID vector, will need be created as standalone objects in the environment. The spirit of using pipe reduces the intermediate data objects that are unnecessarily created in the analysis while in this case, these only-used-once data objects can hardly be incorporated into a piping workflow in the analysis. In addition, if the data is organised as a separate spatial and temporal table as format 2 in Figure \ref{fig:illu-input}, the filter on site ID will need to performed twice in each table to keep them both up-to-date. With the array data structure, although it can easily store and wrangle large spatio-temporal data, the 3D or higher-D array can be less intuitive than a 2D tabular data structure for some analysts in data wrangling. -->

In the \proglang{R} community, many data objects have been proposed to work with specific spatio-temporal tasks, while few can freely explore the data. \pkg{spacetime} [@spacetime] is an attempt for such a data object, but the spatial and temporal class it built on have now been gradually replaced by more recent implementations. The \pkg{stars} [@stars] package uses an array to wrangle spatio-temporal data, but the dense array it uses can quickly exhaust the memory for data in the irregular spatial grid. While there has not yet been a data object that makes it easy to wrangle spatio-temporal data, there is a strong need for such tools given the ubiquitous spatial and temporal data collected in the society, i.e., climate observations from weather stations, air quality variables from air monitoring stations. The demand for such tools can also come from spatial data analysts wishing to incorporate temporal data in their analysis or vice versa.

This paper presents a new \proglang{R} package, \pkg{cubble}, to overcome the problem with organising variables in different levels when working with spatio-temporal data. In the package a new data structure, also called \code{cubble}, is proposed to organise spatial and temporal variables as two forms of a single data object so that they can be wrangled separately while synchronised as a whole piece. With the new data object, analysts can spend less time writing codes to organise spatial and temporal variables and focus more on the exploratory data analysis itself. The software is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at [CRAN link]. 

The rest of the paper is divided as follows: Section 2 presents the main design and functionality of \pkg{cubble}. Section 3 explains how cubble deals with more advanced considerations including data with hierarchical structure, data matching, how cubble fits with existing static and interactive visualisation tools, and spatio-temporal data transformation. Section 4 uses Australia weather station data and river level data as examples to demonstrate the use with \pkg{cubble}. An example on how \pkg{cubble} handles NetCDF data is also provided. Section 5 concludes the paper.
