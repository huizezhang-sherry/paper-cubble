# The cubble package {#cubble}

This section will first introduce the core functions in the cubble class: \code{as_cubble()}, \code{face_spatial()}, \code{face_temporal()}, and \code{unfold()} in subsection \@ref(create) to \@ref(unfold). The next subsection addresses the necessity of creating a new class. Subsection \@ref(compact) will then show the compatibility of cubble with existing packages in spatial and temporal analysis.

Each core function is introduced with a short example accompanied and the data `climate_flat` is used throughout this section. `climate_flat` contains five weather stations in Australia with spatial information of each station: station id, latitude, longitude, elevation, station name and World Meteorology Organisation ID and also daily temporal information of date, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation for 2020. Below prints out the first five rows of `climate_flat`:

```{r}
cubble::climate_flat 
```

## Create a cubble {#create}

Spatio-temporal data can come in various formats and shapes and a cubble can be created from various raw data. This includes tibble and its variates multiple tables (an example provided in section \@ref(covid)), and netcdf (detailed in section \@ref(netcdf)). The function \code{as_cubble()} is used to create a cubble with three additional components: \code{key} as the spatial identifier; \code{index} as the temporal identifier; and a vector of \code{coords} in the order of longitude and latitude. Argument \code{key} and \code{index} follow the wording in \pkg{tsibble} to describe the temporal order and multiple series while \code{coords} is a space specific argument to locate each site in two columns. The code below creates a cubble out of \code{climate_flat} with \code{id} as the key, \code{date} as the index, and \code{c(long, lat)} as the coordinates:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_nested <- climate_flat |>
  as_cubble(key = id, index = date, coords = c(long, lat))
cubble_nested
```

The cubble header provides some information about this data. \code{id} is the variable name to identify each location and there are five unique locations. The bounding box is \code{[115.97, -32.94, 133.55, -12.42]}. In the third row is the the name and type of variable nested in the \code{ts} column and here it includes \code{date [date], prcp [dbl], tmax [dbl], tmin [dbl]}.

The created cubble is built from a \code{rowwise_df} class where each row forms a group. All the temporal variables are nested in a list column, hence it is also called the nested cubble. The rowwise structure makes it simpler to calculate on the list using the \code{mutate()} syntax, which is simplier than the {\code{map()} when working with list column. For example, calculating the number of raining day can be done by:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_nested |> 
  mutate(rain_day = sum(ts$prcp != 0))
```


## Change focus to the time-variable face

The nested form can be used for those operations whose output is only indexed by the spatial identifier (\code{key}), while for those outputs cross-identified by the spatial and temporal identifier (\code{key} and \code{index}), the nested form becomes inadequate. \pkg{cubble} also provides a long form, which expands the \code{ts} column and temporarily "hide" the spatial variables. The function \code{face_temporal()} is used to switch a nested cubble into a long one and the first row in Figure \ref{fig:face} illustrate this operation where the focus of the cube now changes from the site-variable face to the time-variable face. This code switches the cubble just created into its long form:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_long <- cubble_nested |> face_temporal()
cubble_long
```

The first line in the header now shows the cubble is in its long form and the third line has been changed to show the name and type of spatial variables: \code{lat [dbl], long [dbl], elev [dbl], name [chr], wmo_id [dbl]}. Unlike the nested form buildin form a \code{rowwise_df}, the long cubble is built form class \code{groupped_df} where all the observations from the same sites forms a group.

```{r face, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "An illustration of function \\code{face\\_temporal} and \\code{face\\_spatial} in cubble. In the first row, \\code{face\\_temporal} switches a cubble from the nested form into the long form and the focus has switched from the spatial aspect (the side face) to the temporal aspect (the front face). In the second row, \\code{face\\_spatial} switches a cubble back to the nested form from te long form and shift focus back to the spatial aspect."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/diagram-keynotes/diagram-keynotes.008.png"))
```

## Change focus back to the site-variable face

Wrangling spatio-temproal data can be an iterative process on the spatial and temporal dimension. Switching the focus back to the site-variable face can be accomplished by the function \code{face_spatial()}, which is the inverse of \code{face_temporal()}. The second row of Figure \ref{fig:face} illustrates  the function and below is an example on the climate data:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_back <- cubble_long |> face_spatial()
cubble_back
identical(cubble_nested, cubble_back)
```

## Flatten spatial variables into the long cubble {#unfold}

Sometimes, analysts may need to apply some variable transformation that involves both the spatial and temporal variable. An example of this is the transformation of temporal variables into the spatial dimension in glyph maps, which will be elaborated in section \ref{st_transformation}. This type of operations can be seen as flattening, or *unfolding*, the cube into a 2D data frame. Here the function \code{unfold()} moves the spatial variables \code{long} and \code{lat} into the long cubble:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_unfold <- cubble_long |> unfold(long, lat)
cubble_unfold
```

This function should generally be used in the last step of the analysis since it is a temporary operation, meaning these added spatial variables will disappear if switched to the nested form and then switched back:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_unfold |> face_spatial() |> face_temporal()
```

\subsection[Why not just use]{Why not just use \code{dplyr::nest\_by()}}

It may naturally raise the question that why bother a new data structure since the nested form can already be created by \code{dplyr::nest_by()}?  While \code{nest_by()} and \code{unnest()} can mimic the nested form in cubble, cubble can be seen as an attempt to arrange variables from different observational units into a single object, specifically for spatio-temporal data. While `nest_by()` solves this problem on the spatial side, it doesn't solve the temporal side. For temporal data, a combined representation with spatial variables is useful for spatio-temporal operations but its duplication can be a burden to operate on. Also, spatial variables are dropped when summarised and you will need to either specified all of them in the \code{group_by()} before \code{summarise}, or add a joining after \code{summarise()}.


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(dplyr) -->
<!-- vars <- c(id, lat, long, elev, name, wmo_id) -->
<!-- left_join(cubble::stations, cubble::climate) |>  -->
<!--   group_by(id, lat, long, elev, name, wmo_id) |>  -->
<!--   summarise(tmax_mean = mean(tmax)) -->

<!-- cubble::climate |>  -->
<!--   mutate(month = lubridate::month(date)) |>  -->
<!--   group_by(id, month) |>  -->
<!--   summarise(tmax_mean = mean(tmax)) |>  -->
<!--   ungroup() |>  -->
<!--   left_join(cubble::stations) |>  -->
<!--   nest_by(id, lat, long, elev, name, wmo_id) -->


<!-- ``` --

## Compatibility with existing packages {#compact}

The previous four subsections have introduced operations specific to the \code{cubble} class and this section will demonstrate how the \code{cubble} class interacts with existing packages commonly used in spatial and temporal analysis, specifically, \code{dplyr}, \code{tsibble}, \code{sf} (\code{s2}), and \code{netcdf4}.

### dplyr

The \code{dplyr} package has provided many tools for data wrangling tasks and these operations are useful in the spatio-temporal context. \code{cubble} provides methods that support the following \code{dplyr} verbs in both the nested and long form:

 > `mutate`, `filter`, `summarise`, `select`, `arrange`, `rename`, `left_join`, and the slice family (`slice_head`, `slice_tail`, `slice_sample`, `slice_min`, `slice_max`)

### tsibble

\code{tsibble} is a temporal data structure that uses \code{index} and \code{key} to identify the time and different series. \code{cubble} can be seen as following the same vein as \code{tsibble} for spatio-temporal data. This makes it easy to cast a \code{tsibble} into a \code{cubble} as only the \code{coords} argument needs to be supplied:

```{r echo = TRUE}
# example with a tsibble created from climate_flat
raw <- climate_flat |> tsibble::as_tsibble(key = id, index = date)
dt <-  raw |> cubble::as_cubble(coords = c(long, lat))
dt
```

In the nested cubble created, each element in the list-column \code{ts} is of \code{tbl_ts} class and operations available to the tsibble class is still valid under cubble. For example, the code below calculates two features of the maximum temperature:

```{r echo = TRUE}
# add station-based features in the nested form.
dt |> mutate(fabletools::features(ts, tmax, list(tmax_mean = mean, tmax_var = var)))
```

### sf and s2

As a spatial data object, \code{sf} creates a simple feature geometry list-column (\code{sfc}) in the data frame to provide spatial operations on various geometry types (\code{POINT}, \code{LINESTRING}, \code{POLYGON}, \code{MULTIPOLYGON}, etc). These spatial operations are also valuable for spatio-temporal data analysis, but an \code{sf} object *usually* does not contain temporal variables. This means \code{sf} cannot be directly cast into a \code{cubble}, however, \code{cubble} does support \code{sfc} columns in the nested form and spatial operations applied to the \code{sfc} column in \code{sf} can still be applied to the \code{sfc} column in a cubble. The following example shows how to create an \code{sfc} column of \code{POINT} type from latitude and longitude in cubble. Then \code{sf::st_within} is used to add the state \code{MULTIPOLYGON} of each weather station before a coordinate transformation is made.

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(sf)
# create a cubble
cb <- climate_flat |>
  cubble::as_cubble(key = id, index = date, coords = c(long, lat))

aus <- ozmaps::abs_ste

dt <- cb |>
  mutate(
    # create `sfc` column based on long and lat
    ll = st_sfc(
      purrr::map2(long, lat, ~st_point(c(.x, .y))),
      crs = st_crs(aus)),

    # append state multi-polygon based on the `sfc` created
    state = aus$geometry[st_within(ll, aus, sparse = FALSE)],

    # adopt a different projection: lambert conformal conic (EPSG:3112)
    state = st_transform(state, crs = "EPSG:3112")
    )

dt
```

An \pkg{s2} \code{lnglat} vector can similarly be created as an \code{sfc} in cubble before using any \code{s2}-prefixed function:

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(s2)
# Western Australia map
wa <- ozmaps::abs_ste |> filter(NAME == "Western Australia")

# mutate a `s2_lnglat` vector on `cb` created in the last chunk
cb |>
  mutate(ll = s2_lnglat(long, lat)) |>
  filter(s2_within(ll, wa))
```


### netcdf {#netcdf}

NetCDF data has two main components: *dimension* for defining the spatio-temporal grid (longitude, latitude, and time) and *variable* that populates the defined grid. Attributes are usually associated with dimension and variable in the NetCDF format data and a [metadata convention for climate and forecast](http://cfconventions.org/) has been designed to standardise the format of the attributes. A few packages in R exists for manipulating NetCDF data and this includes a high-level R interface: \pkg{ncdf4} [@ncdf4], a low-level interface that calls C-interface: \pkg{RNetCDF} [@rnetcdf; @michna2013rnetcdf], and a tidyverse implementation: \pkg{tidync} [@tidync].

Cubble provides an \code{as_cubble()} method to coerce the \code{ncdf4} class from the \pkg{ncdf4} package into a \code{cubble}. It maps each combination of longitude and latitude into an \code{id} as the \code{key}:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# read in the .nc file as a ncdf4 class
raw <- ncdf4::nc_open(here::here("data/era5-pressure.nc"))

# convert the variable q and z in the ncdf4 into a cubble
dt <- as_cubble(raw, vars = c("q", "z"))
```

The memory limit with NetCDF data in cubble depends on the number of longitude grid points times the number of latitude grid points times the number of time grid points times the number of variables. Cubble can handle slightly more than 300 x 300 (longitude x longitude) grid points for 3 variables in one year. The spatial grid can be reduced to trade for longer time periods and more variables. A 300 by 300 spatial grid can be a bounding box of [100, -80, 180, 0] at 0.25 degree resolution or a global bounding box [-180, -90, 180, -90] at 1 degree resolution. Subsetting longitude and latitude grids is available through \code{long_range} and \code{lat_range} if the NetCDF file has finer resolution than needed.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Assume my_ncdf has bounding box of [-180, -90, 180, -90]
# at 0.25 degree resolution and subset it to have
# 1 degree resolution:
dt <- as_cubble(my_ncdf, vars = c("q", "z"),
                long_range = seq(-180, 180, 1),
                lat_range = seq(-90, 90, 1))
```
