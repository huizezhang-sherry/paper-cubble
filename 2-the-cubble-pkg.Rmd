# The cubble package

\textcolor{red}{more beginning} In cubble data can represented in two formats: nested form and long form, and Figure \ref{fig:illu-cubble} sketches the two forms with the associated attributes. The decision on which form to use in data manipulation is output-oriented, meaning analysts need to first think about whether the output of an operation is identified only by the spatial identifier, or a combination of spatial and temporal identifier. The nested cubble is suitable for working with operations that are only identified by the site and this type of operation can be a pure manipulation of time invariant variables, or an operation that summarises time varying variables into site. Underneath the nested form, a cubble is built from a \code{rowwise_df} class where each site forms a separate group. This structure simplifies the calculation that involves temporal variables by avoiding the use of \code{purrr::map()} syntax when working with list-column.

For those operations whose output involves both a spatial and temporal identifier, long form should be used. The long form uses a  \code{grouped_df} class to forms all the time of a site as a group. Time invariant variables are stored separately as an special attribute of the long cubble. This design avoids repeating the spatial variables at each time stamp while not dropping information from spatial variables.

```{r illu-cubble, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "An illustration of the nested and long form in cubble. The nested form defines each site in a row and nests the time varying variables into a single column \\code{ts}. The long form cubble uses \\code{id} and \\code{t} to identify each row and store the time invariant variables as an attribute, \\code{spatial}."}

## Create a cubble in the nested form

To use functions in the `cubble` package, an analyst will need to first turn the data object into a \code{cubble} class. \code{as_cubble()} does this through supplying the three key components: \code{key} as the spatial identifier; \code{index} as the temporal identifier; and a vector of \code{coords} in the order of longitude and latitude. The use of \code{key} and \code{index} follows the convention in the \pkg{tsibble} package. The cubble created by default is in the nested form.

Before the formal examples in Section \ref{examples}, each function introduced in this section will be demonstrated with a short example with a data that contains 5 Australia weather stations, a subset of hundreds of weather stations in Australia. This dataset contains spatial information of each station: station id, latitude, longitude, elevation, station name and World Meteorology Organisation ID and also daily temporal information: date, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation for 2020. \code{climate_flat} stores this data in format 1) in Figure \ref{fig:illu-input} and the code below creates a cubble out of \code{climate_flat} with \code{id} as the key, \code{date} as the index, and \code{c(long, lat)} as the coordinates:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_nested <- cubble::climate_flat %>%
  as_cubble(key = id, index = date, coords = c(long, lat))
cubble_nested
```

There are a few information in the cubble header: the name of the \code{key} variable: \code{id} and its unique number: 5, the bounding box: \code{[115.97, -32.94, 133.55, -12.42]} , and also the name of variable nested in the \code{ts} column with its type: \code{date [date], prcp [dbl], tmax [dbl], tmin [dbl]}. 

## Stretch a nested cubble into the long form

The nested format is convenient for those operations whose output doesn't contain a time dimension, for those that are identified by both the spatial and temporal identifier, a long cubble is more suitable. Analysts will need to switch the nested cubble into a long cubble for such operation and \code{stretch()} is designed for this purpose: it first extracts all the spatial variables into a separate tibble and then unnests the \code{ts} column. This code switches the nested cubble just created into its long form:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_long <- cubble_nested %>% stretch(ts)
cubble_long
```

Notice that the third line in the header now shows the name and type of spatial variables: \code{lat [dbl], long [dbl], elev [dbl], name [chr], wmo_id [dbl]}. The spatial variables are still part of the data object but as a \code{spatial} attribute:

```{r}
attr(cubble_long, "spatial")
```

## Tamp a long cubble back to the nested form

Manipulation on the spatial and temporal dimension can be an iterative process and analysts may need to go back and forth between the nested and long cubble. \code{tamp()}, an inverse of \code{stretch()}, switches a long cubble to a nested cubble:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_back <- cubble_long %>% tamp()
cubble_back
```

## Migrate spatial variables to a long cubble

Sometimes, analysts may need the spatial and temporal variable to be in the same table to apply some variable transformation. Cubble allows this operation through \code{migrate()}, which  moves the specified spatial variables into the long cubble:

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_mig <- cubble_long %>% migrate(long, lat)
cubble_mig
```

This operation should generally be used in the last step of the analysis since it is a temporary operation, meaning meaning these added spatial variables will disappear if switched to the nested form and then switched back: 

```{r echo = TRUE}
cubble_mig %>% tamp() %>% stretch()
```

## Compatibility with existing packages

The last 4 subsections introduces operations specific to the \code{cubble} class and this section will demonstrate how the \code{cubble} class interacts with existing packages, specifically, \code{dplyr}, \code{tsibble}, \code{sf}, and \code{netcdf4}.

### dplyr

Building from an \code{tbl_df} class, cubble has implemented methods for \pkg{dplyr} generics, which includes:

  - basic: mutate, filter, summarise, select, arrange, rename, left_join
  - grouping: group_by, ungroup
  - slice family: slice_head, slice_tail, slice_sample, slice_min, slice_max

### tsibble

Cubble is also compatible with \pkg{tsibble}. When creating a cubble from a tsibble, only the \code{coords} argument needs to be specified: 

```{r echo = TRUE}
# casting a tsibble into cubble
dt <- climate_flat %>% 
  tsibble::as_tsibble(key = id, index = date) %>% 
  cubble::as_cubble(coords = c(long, lat))
dt
```

In the created nested form, each element of the list-column \code{ts} is of \code{tbl_ts} class and existing operations on the tsibble class can still be applied:
  
```{r echo = TRUE}
# add station-based features in the nested form.
dt %>% 
  mutate(fabletools::features(ts, tmax, list(tmax_mean = mean, tmax_var = var)))
```

### sf and s2

Cubble is compatible with simple feature geometry list-column (\code{sfc}) in \pkg{sf} and  \code{s2_lnglat} vector in \pkg{S2} in the nested form. After creating a cubble, analysts can add the geometry vectors as needed to perform spatial operations: 

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(s2)
# create a cubble
cb <- climate_flat %>% 
  cubble::as_cubble(key = id, index = date, coords = c(long, lat))

# western australia map
wa <- ozmaps::abs_ste %>% filter(NAME == "Western Australia")

# create a `s2_lnglat` vector based on long and lat and filter stations in wa
cb %>%
  mutate(ll = s2_lnglat(long, lat)) %>% 
  filter(s2_within(ll, wa))
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(sf)
# simplify australia map
aus <- ozmaps::abs_ste %>% rmapshaper::ms_simplify(keep = 0.01)

dt <- cb %>%
  mutate(
    # create `sfc` column based on long and lat
    ll = st_sfc(
      purrr::map2(long, lat, ~st_point(c(.x, .y))),
      crs = st_crs(aus)),
    # append state multi-polygon based on the `sfc` created
    state = aus$geometry[st_within(ll, aus, sparse = FALSE)],
    # adopt a different projection: lambert conformal conic (EPSG:3112)
    state = st_transform(state, crs = "EPSG:3112"))

dt
```


### netcdf

NetCDF data has two main components: *dimension* for defining the spatio-temporal grid (longitude, latitude, and time) and *variable* that populates the defined grid. Attributes are usually associated with dimension and variable in the NetCDF format data and a [metadata convention for climate and forecast](http://cfconventions.org/) has been designed to standardise the format of the attributes. A few packages in R exists for manipulating NetCDF data and this includes a high-level R interface: \pkg{ncdf4} [@ncdf4], a low-level interface that calls C-interface: \pkg{RNetCDF} [@rnetcdf; @michna2013rnetcdf], and a tidyverse implementation: \pkg{tidync} [@tidync].

Cubble provides an \code{as_cubble()} method to coerce the \code{ncdf4} class from the \pkg{ncdf4} package into a \code{cubble}. It maps each combination of longitude and latitude into an \code{id} as the \code{key}:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# read in the .nc file as a ncdf4 class
raw <- ncdf4::nc_open(here::here("data/era5-pressure.nc"))

# convert the variable q and z in the ncdf4 into a cubble
dt <- as_cubble(raw, vars = c("q", "z"))
```

Memory limit with NetCDF data in cubble depends on longitude grid point x latitude grid point x time grid point x number of variable. Cubble can handle slightly more than 300 x 300 (longitude x longitude) grid points for 3 variables in one year and spatial grid can be reduced to trade for longer time period and more variables. A 300 by 300 spatial grid can be a bounding box of [100, -80, 180, 0] at 0.25 degree resolution or a global bounding box [-180, -90, 180, -90] at 1 degree resolution. Subsetting longitude and latitude grid is available through \code{long_range} and \code{lat_range} if the NetCDF file has finer resolution than needed.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Assume my_ncdf has bounding box of [-180, -90, 180, -90] 
# at 0.25 degree resolution and subset it to have 
# 1 degree resolution:
dt <- as_cubble(my_ncdf, vars = c("q", "z"), 
                long_range = seq(-180, 180, 1), 
                lat_range = seq(-90, 90, 1))
```
