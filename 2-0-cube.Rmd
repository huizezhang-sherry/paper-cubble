<!-- and software implementation has been seen in many R packages: \pkg{raster} [@raster], \pkg{terra} [@terra], and \pkg{stars} [@stars]. -->

<!-- # Existing work and new challenges -->

<!-- Spatio-temporal software should echo with the advance in spatial and temporal data analysis. This section will start with the \pkg{spacetime} paper [@spacetime] that sets the foundation for wrangling spatio-temporal data in \proglang{R}, and then describe some emerging concepts and software in data analysis since the paper publishes and what remains as challenges. -->


<!-- Also, array is not the best solution for a large subset of data, specifically, the vector spatio-temporal data. With vector data, spatial and temporal variables are commonly collected in separate 2D tables and there is usually a location ID to link the spatial and temporal information. Sometimes, the geometrical shape of the location may not present and an additional linking is needed to incorporate the map data. With the multiple pieces in 2D data frame format, there should be a solution to organise all these data from multiple sources in a 2D structure, without needing to convert it into higher dimensional representation. -->


# Conceptual framework: spatio-temporal cube {#cube}

Multivariate spatio-temporal data can be conceptualised using a cubical data model with reference to variables, time and space. This naturally motivates the usage of array to represent and store spatio-temporal data, as evident by satellite imageries, large climate models, among others. The work by @lu_multidimensional_2018 has discussed the suitability of this representation through array algebra and practical spatio-temporal tasks.  

The cubical conceptual framework provides a generalisation to the operation can be done on the data for visualisation. A paper by @bach_review_2014 has reviewed the temporal data visualisation based on space-time cube operations. Notice that the term space-time cube in their article "does not need to involve spatial data", but referring to "an abstract 2D substrate that is used to visualize data at a specific time". Despite its main focus is on temporal data, the mindset of abstracting out data representation to construct visualisation is applicable to our spatio-temporal data manipulation and visualisation.
