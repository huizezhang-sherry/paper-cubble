# Conceptual framework

Multivariate spatio-temporal data can be conceptualised using a cubical data model with reference to variables, time and space. This naturally motivates the usage of array to represent and store spatio-temporal data, as evident by satellite imageries, large climate models, among others. The work by @lu_multidimensional_2018 has discussed the suitability of this representation through array algebra and practical spatio-temporal tasks and software implementation has been seen in many R packages: \pkg{raster} [@raster], \pkg{terra} [@terra], and \pkg{stars} [@stars].

While it is efficient to represent spatio-temporal data in an array, there are situation where array [is not the best solution]. mutate in the array is not clearly define (how to add a column vector)

Also, array is not the best solution for a large subset of data, specifically, the vector spatio-temporal data. With vector data, spatial and temporal variables are commonly collected in separate 2D tables and there is usually a location ID to link the spatial and temporal information. Sometimes, the geometrical shape of the location may not present and an additional linking is needed to incorporate the map data. With the multiple pieces in 2D data frame format, there should be a solution to organise all these data from multiple sources in a 2D structure, without needing to convert it into higher dimensional representation.

Reliable software and data structure has been proposed in the spatial and temporal domain, while a direct extension to spatio-temporal data is not ideal. The main issue here lays in the format that spatial and temporal data is stored. For spatial data, \pkg{sf} [@sf] covers a wide range of geometrical operations and is the format most map data stored. When incorporating the time dimension, a time wide format, introduced in @spacetime, is usually adopted. This treats time as variable name rather than value and makes it inconvenient to wrangle time, as per the tidy data principle [@tidydata]. In the temporal domain, \pkg{tsibble} [@tsibble] follows the tidy data principle to arrange the time in the long format, while when adding spatial variables, a long format implies repeating variables at each time and this can make a huge difference when the repetition is on large geometrical shapes with long time period.
