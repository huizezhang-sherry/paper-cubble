# Introduction 

Spatio-temporal data 

Motivation: Many focus on spatio/ temporal solely -> spatio-temporal vector data structure for data analysis

sections

# Literature Review

Existing R pkgs for spatio/ temporal data

- `sp` + `spacetime` (time series data from package `xts`)

- `sf` 
  - simple features geometry 
  - only spatio
  - good for geographical but these geometry types i.e. multipolygon, can be hard to manipulate. Would be nice to have a vector data structure

- `stars`
  - a newer structure allow both spatio + temporal 
  - array

# A new data structure for spatio-temporal data

Intro to cubble: 

- list-column: rowwise_df with temporal variables, including the time index, nested. 
  - Focus on spatio: those output per station

- long form: grouped_df 
  - Focus on temporal

Compatible with tidyverse manipulation and tsibble

# Examples

Daily climate data (prcp, tmax, and tmin) from RNOAA - lots of stations across Australia

An exploratory data analysis questions: What's the climate profile look like in Australia

  - General features: Any general trend/ fluctuation in prcp, tmax, and tmin?
  - Local features: Any station stands out from the crowd?

## Manipulation

  - data quality check: filter out stations have variables not properly recorded 
  - data summary: 
    - daily -> monthly/ weekly, 
    - summarise by mean for tmax/ tmin, sum for prcp
  - 

## Graphics

Static + interactive -> tooltip to show additional information upon hovering

  - Where are those stations on the map? 
    - Mention mostly aero, airport, and lighthouse
