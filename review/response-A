From the editorial team:

o Combine main article and appendix into a single PDF. The appendix should be included as appendix in the main article file, but with usual style.
  
  - see the submitted-article.pdf

o Provide a single R script which contains the code to reproduce the results. Providing also the html file obtained when executing is recommended, but not compulsory.

  - see the R script: reproducible-script.R

o Maybe it would be preferable to use the new |> pipe consisently in main and appendix.

  - changed to use |> instead of %>% 

Manuscript style comments:

The code presented in the manuscript should not contain comments within the verbatim code. Instead the comments should be made in the normal LaTeX text.

  - comments in the code have been removed. 

o For R-related manuscripts: The first argument of data() and library() should always be quoted, e.g., library("foo").

  - quoted libraries when loaded as library("foo")

o If using "e.g." and "i.e." add a comma after the period to keep LaTeX from interpreting them as the end of a sentence, i.e.: "e.g., " and "i.e., ".

  - "e.g." & "i.e." -> "e.g., " & "i.e., "

o For bullet lists/itemized lists please use either a comma, semi-colon, or period at the end of each item.
  
  - added semi-colon between bullet lists and period at the end in section 4.2

o Abbreviations should be spelled in upper-case letters without additional formatting (i.e., without periods, without small caps, italics, etc.).  All abbreviations should be introduced with their expansion where the expansion should not be capitalized.

  - revised 

o As a reminder, please make sure that:
	- \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.
