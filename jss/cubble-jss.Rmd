abstract: >
    Multivariate spatio-temporal data refers to multiple measurements taken across space and time. For many analyses, spatial and time components can be separately studied: for example, to explore the temporal trend of one variable for a single spatial location, or to model the spatial distribution of one variable at a given time. However for some studies, it is important to analyse different aspects of the spatio-temporal data simultaneouly, like for instance, temporal trends of multiple variables across locations. In order to facilitate the study of different portions or combinations of spatio-temporal data, we introduce a new data structure, \code{cubble}, with a suite of functions enabling easy slicing and dicing on the different components spatio-temporal components.  The proposed \code{cubble} structure ensures that all the components of the data are easy to access and manipulate while providing flexibility for data analysis. In addition, \code{cubble} facilitates visual and numerical explorations of the data while easing data wrangling and modelling. The \code{cubble} structure and the functions provided in the \code{cubble} R package equip users with the capability to handle hierarchical spatial and temporal structures. The \code{cubble} structure and the tools implemented in the package are illustrated with different examples of Australian climate data.
