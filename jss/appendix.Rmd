# Appendix

Figure \ref{fig:illu-interactive-2} illustrates the linking pipeline from a point selection on the time series to the map.

```{r illu-interactive-2, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", out.height="40%", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "An illustration of the data model under interactive graphics with cubble. When a point on the time series is selected, the corresponding row in the long cubble will be activated. This will link to all the rows with the same id in the long cubble and the row in the nested cubble with the same id (middle). Both plots will be updated with the full line selected and the point highlighted on the map (right)."}
