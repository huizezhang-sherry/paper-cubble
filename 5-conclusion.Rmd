# Conclusion {#conclude}

This paper presents an \proglang{R} package \pkg{cubble} for organising, manipulating and visualising spatio-temporal data. The package introduces a new data structure for spatio-temporal data, \code{cubble}, that connects the time invariant and varying variables and that allows the user to work with a nested and long form of the data. TThe goal of this work is to add capabilities into the spatio-temporal practitioners toolbox that facilitates their work within the tidy data framework. The data structure and the capabilities introduced in this package can be used and combined with existing spatio-temporal R packages such as \pkg{sf}, data wrangling packages such as \pkg{dplyr}, and visualization packages such as \pkg{ggplot2}, \pkg{plotly} and \pkg{leaflet}.

The data structure and functions are demonstrated with extensive examples. These include creating and coercing wild-caught data with potential mismatch on sites, handling hierarchical data, matching time series spatially and temporally, as well as reproducing ERA5 results from NetCDF data. Visualization of the \code{cubble} objects and derivatives is presented via interactive graphic pipelines using \pkg{plotly} and \pkg{leaflet}.

Future directions of the package involves handling sites with moving coordinates. This would involve constructing a list-column for location coordinates and a form these locations can be pivoted into, like the long form for temporal variables. In the multivariate aspect, \pkg{cubble} can also be extended with interface to more high dimensional visualisation methods, i.e., the tour method, to understand variable importance or comparing location similarities.
