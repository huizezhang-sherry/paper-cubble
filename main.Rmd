abstract: >
  Spatio-temporal data have two types of variables: spatial variables have fixed value across time in the same location while temporal variables need both the location and timestamp to identify its value. These variables can be organised in two separate tables, each focusing on one aspect of the data, or a single table that combines all the variables together. For exploratory data analysis and visualisation, analysts needs both formats for different types of exploration, while it can be tedious to constantly split and join variables in order to cast the data into the desireable shape. In this paper, a new data structure, \code{cubble}, is proposed for exploring spatio-temporal data. The new data structure organises spatial and temporal variables as two forms of a single data object so that they can be wrangled separately while keep syncronised. Considerations are given to data with hierarchical structure, data matching and explain how \pkg{cubble} fits in with the interactive graphics pipeline and spatio-temporal transformation. Examples are given to analysing Australia meteorology data, river level data, and climate reanalysis (ERA5) data.
